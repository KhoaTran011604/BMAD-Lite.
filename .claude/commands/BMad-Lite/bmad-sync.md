## Example: Adding New Epic

```
User: /sync epic

Current Epics:
1. Foundation (5 stories) - DONE
2. Core Features (8 stories) - DONE

New Epic will be: Epic 3

Please provide:
1. Epic Title: Reporting & Analytics
2. Epic Goal: Enable users to view reports and export data
3. Estimated stories: 4

Checking architecture impact...

This epic requires:
[x] New data models (Report, ExportJob)
[x] New API endpoints (/reports, /exports)
[x] New components (ReportViewer)

Updating architecture first, then PRD...

SYNC COMPLETE:
✓ docs/architecture.md updated
✓ docs/architecture/data-models.md updated
✓ docs/prd.md updated (Epic 3 added)
✓ docs/epics/epic-3.md created
✓ .ai/progress.md updated

Next: /execute draft to start Story 3.1
```

---

## Example: Adding New Story

```
User: /sync story

Select epic for new story:
1. Epic 1: Foundation (5 stories)
2. Epic 2: Core Features (8 stories)
3. Epic 3: Reporting (4 stories)

> 2

New story will be: Story 2.9

Story information:
- Title: Bulk Export
- As a: admin, I want: to export multiple items, so that: I can analyze data offline
- AC: Given items selected, When export clicked, Then CSV downloads

Architecture impact: None (uses existing export service)

SYNC COMPLETE:
✓ docs/prd.md updated (Story 2.9 added)
✓ docs/epics/epic-2.md updated
✓ .ai/progress.md updated

Next: /execute draft 2.9 to create story file
```

## Best Practices

1. **Sync early, sync often** - Don't let docs drift too far
2. **Architecture first** - Update technical docs before requirements
3. **Validate references** - Ensure all cross-links work
4. **Run /sync all periodically** - Weekly for active projects
