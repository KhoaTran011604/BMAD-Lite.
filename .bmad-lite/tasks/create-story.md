# Create Story Task

Detailed workflow for drafting a new story for implementation.

---

## When to Use

- Starting development on a new story
- After planning phase is complete
- When moving to next story in epic

---

## Prerequisites

- PRD exists at `docs/prd.md` (with epic details) OR
- Epic file exists at `docs/epics/epic-{n}.md`
- Architecture exists at `docs/architecture.md`

---

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Identify Next Story

```
1. Check .ai/stories/ for existing story files
2. Find highest story number completed/in-progress
3. Determine next sequential story
4. If epic complete, prompt user:
   - Continue to Epic {n+1}?
   - Select specific story?
```

**Decision tree:**
```
.ai/stories/ is empty?
├── YES → Start with Story 1.1
└── NO  → Find last story
          ├── Last was X.Y (not last in epic) → Next is X.(Y+1)
          └── Last was X.Z (last in epic) → Prompt for Epic X+1
```

**Output:** Story identifier (e.g., "1.3")

---

### Step 2: Load Story Source

```
1. Identify source:
   - If docs/epics/epic-{n}.md exists → use epic file
   - Else → use docs/prd.md Epic Details section

2. Extract story content:
   - Story statement (As a... I want... So that...)
   - Acceptance Criteria (numbered list)
   - Dependencies noted in source
```

**Output:** Story statement and AC

---

### Step 3: Load Architecture Context

```
1. Read docs/architecture.md
2. Extract relevant sections for Dev Notes:
   - Source Tree (file locations)
   - Data Models (relevant entities)
   - API Spec (relevant endpoints)
   - Coding Standards (key rules)
   - Test Strategy (testing requirements)

3. If previous story exists (.ai/stories/{prev}.md):
   - Read Dev Record section
   - Extract key learnings/insights
```

**Output:** Dev Notes content with source references

---

### Step 4: Generate Tasks

```
1. Analyze AC to determine implementation tasks
2. Break down into specific, actionable tasks
3. Each task references relevant AC numbers
4. Add subtasks for complex tasks
5. Ensure testing is included
```

**Task generation rules:**
- Each AC should have at least one task covering it
- Tasks should be completable in one focused session
- Include test writing as explicit tasks
- Order tasks logically (setup → implement → test)

**Output:** Task list with AC references

---

### Step 5: Suggest Skills

```
1. Analyze task types:
   - New feature? → @test-driven-development
   - API work? → @api-design-principles
   - React/UI? → @react-best-practices
   - Debugging? → @systematic-debugging

2. Check Skills/ folder for available skills
3. List 2-3 most relevant skills
```

**Output:** Suggested skills list

---

### Step 6: Create Story File

**File location:** `.ai/stories/{epic}.{story}.md`

**Use template:** `.bmad-lite/templates/story.yaml`

```markdown
# Story {epic}.{story}: {title}

**Status:** Draft
**Epic:** {epic_title}
**Created:** {today}
**Last Updated:** {today}

## Story

**As a** {user_type},
**I want** {action},
**so that** {benefit}.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given {context}, When {action}, Then {expected}
2. Given {context}, When {action}, Then {expected}
3. ...

## Tasks

- [ ] Task 1: {description} (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: {specific action}
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: {specific action}
- [ ] Task 2: {description} (AC: 3)
- [ ] Task 3: Write and run tests (AC: 1, 2, 3)
