# Refactor Docs Task

Restructure documentation to keep them lean and focused.

---

## Purpose

When PRD and Architecture grow too large, this command helps:
- **PRD** → Contains only requirements (What & Why)
- **Architecture** → Contains only technical decisions (How)
- **Details** → Extracted to external files for easy maintenance

---

## Principles

### 1. PRD Focuses On (What & Why)

| Keep In PRD | Extract Out |
|-------------|-------------|
| Goals & Background | ❌ Keep |
| Functional Requirements (FR) | ❌ Keep |
| Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) | ❌ Keep |
| UI Design Goals (high-level) | Detailed wireframes → `docs/ui/` |
| Epic List (titles + goals) | ❌ Keep |
| Story statements + AC | Detailed tasks → `.ai/stories/` |

### 2. Architecture Focuses On (How - Decisions)

| Keep In Architecture | Extract Out |
|---------------------|-------------|
| High-level overview | ❌ Keep |
| Tech Stack table | ❌ Keep |
| Data Models (summary) | Full schemas → `docs/architecture/data-models.md` |
| API Spec (endpoints list) | Full OpenAPI → `docs/architecture/api-spec.yaml` |
| Component overview | Full specs → `docs/architecture/components/` |
| Source Tree | ❌ Keep |
| Coding Standards | ❌ Keep |
| Security (overview) | Full spec → `docs/architecture/security.md` |

### 3. External Files Structure

```
docs/
├── prd.md                    # Lean PRD (requirements only)
├── architecture.md           # Lean Architecture (decisions only)
├── epics/                    # Epic details (optional)
│   ├── epic-1.md
│   └── epic-2.md
├── architecture/             # Architecture details
│   ├── data-models.md        # Full data model specs
│   ├── api-spec.yaml         # Full OpenAPI spec
│   ├── api-spec.md           # API documentation
│   ├── components.md         # Component specifications
│   ├── security.md           # Security details
│   └── infrastructure.md     # Deployment details
└── ui/                       # UI specifications (optional)
    ├── wireframes/
    └── design-system.md
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Current Docs

```
1. Read docs/prd.md
2. Read docs/architecture.md
3. Identify sections that are too detailed:
   - PRD section > 50 lines → candidate for extraction
   - Architecture section > 100 lines → candidate for extraction
   - Any section with implementation details
```

**Output:** List of sections to refactor

---

### Step 2: Plan Extraction

For each oversized section, create extraction plan:

```
Section: {name}
Current location: {prd.md|architecture.md}#{section}
Lines: {count}
Action: Extract to {target_file}
Keep in original: {summary with reference}
```

**Present plan to user for approval before proceeding**

---

### Step 3: Create External Files

For each extraction:

```markdown
# {Section Title}

**Source:** Extracted from {prd.md|architecture.md}
**Last synced:** {date}

---

{Full content from original section}
```

---

### Step 4: Update Original Docs

Replace detailed section with summary + reference:

**Before (in architecture.md):**
```markdown
## Data Models

### User
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key |
| email | string | User email, unique |
| password | string | Hashed password |
| name | string | Display name |
| role | enum | admin, user, guest |
| createdAt | timestamp | Creation time |
| updatedAt | timestamp | Last update |
| lastLogin | timestamp | Last login time |
| preferences | json | User preferences |
| ... (50 more lines)

### Product
| Field | Type | Description |
| ... (100 more lines)
```

**After (in architecture.md):**
```markdown
## Data Models

Core entities for this application:

| Entity | Purpose | Key Fields |
|--------|---------|------------|
| User | User accounts | id, email, role |
| Product | Product catalog | id, name, price |
| Order | Purchase orders | id, userId, items |

→ **Full specifications:** [data-models.md](architecture/data-models.md)
```

---

### Step 5: Add Reference Section

At the end of refactored docs, add:

**In PRD:**
```markdown
## Document References

| Document | Contains |
|----------|----------|
| [architecture.md](architecture.md) | Technical decisions |
| [epics/](epics/) | Epic details |
| [ui/](ui/) | UI specifications |
```

**In Architecture:**
```markdown
## Document References

| Document | Contains |
|----------|----------|
| [data-models.md](architecture/data-models.md) | Full data model specs |
| [api-spec.yaml](architecture/api-spec.yaml) | OpenAPI specification |
| [components.md](architecture/components.md) | Component details |
| [security.md](architecture/security.md) | Security specifications |
```

---

### Step 6: Validate References

```
1. Check all internal links work
2. Verify no orphaned content
3. Ensure bidirectional references
4. Run consistency check
```

---

## Refactor Patterns

### Pattern 1: Data Models Extraction

**Keep in architecture.md:**
```markdown
## Data Models

| Entity | Purpose | Relations |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| User | User accounts | → Orders, Reviews |
| Product | Product catalog | → Categories, Orders |

→ [Full specifications](architecture/data-models.md)
```

**Extract to architecture/data-models.md:**
```markdown
# Data Models

## User

### Schema
| Field | Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------|
| id | UUID | PK | Primary identifier |
| email | string | UNIQUE, NOT NULL | User email |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### TypeScript Interface
\`\`\`typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  // ...
}
\`\`\`

### Validation Rules
- Email must be unique
- Password minimum 8 characters
- Name maximum 100 characters
```

---

### Pattern 2: API Spec Extraction

**Keep in architecture.md:**
```markdown
## API Specification

REST API with JWT authentication.

| Resource | Endpoints | Auth |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Users | CRUD + auth | Mixed |
| Products | CRUD | Admin |
| Orders | CRUD | User |

→ [Full OpenAPI spec](architecture/api-spec.yaml)
→ [API documentation](architecture/api-spec.md)
```

**Extract to architecture/api-spec.yaml:**
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: My API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /api/users:
    get:
      summary: List users
      ...
    post:
      summary: Create user
      ...
```

---

### Pattern 3: Epic Details Extraction

**Keep in PRD:**
```markdown
## Epics

| Epic | Goal | Stories |
|------|------|---------|
| 1. Foundation | Project setup | 5 stories |
| 2. Core Features | Main functionality | 8 stories |

→ [Epic details](epics/)
```

**Extract to epics/epic-1.md:**
```markdown
# Epic 1: Foundation

## Goal
Establish project infrastructure and core setup.

## Stories

### Story 1.1: Project Setup
As a developer, I want a configured project...

### Story 1.2: Authentication
...
```

---

## Size Guidelines

### Target Sizes After Refactor

| Document | Max Lines | Focus |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| prd.md | ~200 lines | Requirements only |
| architecture.md | ~300 lines | Decisions only |
| data-models.md | Unlimited | Full specifications |
| api-spec.yaml | Unlimited | Full OpenAPI |
| components.md | Unlimited | Full specifications |

### When to Extract

| Section | Extract When |
|---------|--------------|
| Data Models | > 50 lines per entity |
| API Spec | > 10 endpoints |
| Components | > 5 components with details |
| Security | > 30 lines |
| Epic Details | > 3 stories per epic |

---

## Command

```bash
/refactor docs        # Analyze and refactor all docs
/refactor prd         # Refactor PRD only
/refactor arch        # Refactor Architecture only

# In planner agent
*refactor-docs
*refactor-docs prd
